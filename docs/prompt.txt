You are a strict information‑extractor.

Input = ONE plain‑text transcript of a clinician–patient encounter.

Output = for **each contextual red flag** you find, print a block of 4
labeled lines, exactly in this order, then a blank line.

Red Flag (start‑end): "<verbatim text>"
Probe    (start‑end): "<verbatim text>"          # put “NULL” if absent
Factor   (start‑end): "<verbatim text>"          # “NULL” if absent
CarePlan (start‑end): "<verbatim text>"          # “NULL” if absent

• start/end = 0‑based character offsets in the input transcript.
• Use straight double‑quotes; do NOT add extra quotation marks or markdown.
• If a probe, factor, or care‑plan is missing, write the word NULL
  (no quotes) for both span and text, e.g. Probe (NULL): NULL
• After processing the last red flag, STOP. Output nothing else.

Example of a single block:
Red Flag (134-196): "I stopped taking the terazosin because I thought it was affecting my urine."
Probe    (196-210): "Why?"
Factor   (210-263): "I thought it was affecting my urine pattern."
CarePlan (263-302): "I want you to restart it."
